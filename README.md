# Module-1-challenge
# Horiseon Webpage

# Description
The purpose of this project was to make changes to the existing webpage, what I have learnt was how to add semantic html elements follwing a structured styling and positioning. I have added heading elements that fall in sequential order and also image and icon elements using alt attributes. From this challenge I have understood that using semantic HTML code allows for easier readable code and greater accessibility.
